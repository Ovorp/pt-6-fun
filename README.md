I am so glad you found this project, add your own html, CSS, and JS to this project.  Maybe add a get to know you page, or add a JS game you created (like tic-tac-toe).  This is a place to try new things and to practice different git commands.  DO NOT BE AFRAID OF BREAKING THIS REPO.

1.  Fork the Project
2.  Add and commit any changes
3.  Make sure you pull down any new changes
4.  Create a pull request to add your changes in
5.  Come talk to me if you have any questions

Note: try to have your commit commands in imperative, present tense.  Here is an article on [meaningful commit messages](https://reflectoring.io/meaningful-commit-messages/#:~:text=Use%20the%20imperative%2C%20present%20tense.&text=We%20use%20an%20imperative%20verb,for%20new%20user%20registration%E2%80%9D).)
